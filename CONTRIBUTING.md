# Contributing to SODS

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SODS. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Design Decisions

SODS was designed with the next objetives:

- It must be simple (SODS relates to -> Simple-Ods). The API must be straightforward to follow, an user should be able to use just peeking an example.
- It must be light-weight. Avoiding dependencies when it's possible.
- Trustworthy, the project follows [fail-fast principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast_system).
- Don't break anything. The library must be retro-compatible acording to [software versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning). So an user using the version v1.1 of the library should be able to compile and use newer versions v1.y without touching anything. The idea is to keep a stable API.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is published inside Projects tab:
